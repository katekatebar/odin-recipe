    <p>
      My recipe is for traditional Mexican horchata but I’ve seen versions around 
      the web to fit today’s different diet needs: Some use almond or coconut 
      milk to make it lactose-free or they use no calorie-sweeteners for 
      diabetic needs. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While they may taste good, nothing beats the taste of the traditional 
      version! <strong>It’s creamy, flavorful and so refreshing.</strong> I hope
      you treat yourself to the real deal at least once in a while.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by soaking the rice, cinnamon, and almonds in a bowl of water 
        all night, or at least for 5 hours so that the rice softens slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the water from the cinnamon, rice, and almond mixture that were 
        soaking, disposing of water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the cinnamon, rice, and almond mixture with evaporated milk until 
        a smoother mix is formed and the grains of rice are completely ground.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the resulting liquid into a pitcher, and add the sugar, vanilla, 
        and milk. Mix well until everything is well combined.Add a liter of 
        water, and serve with ice. Enjoy!
