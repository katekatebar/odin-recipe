  <h1>Strawberry Milk</h1>
  <p>This Homemade Strawberry Milk is loaded with the flavor of fresh 
    strawberries. This easy 3-ingredient strawberry syrup is made with real 
    ingredients, no dyes or artificial flavorings. Use fresh or frozen 
    strawberries and any dairy or plant-based milk that you choose. This is an 
    easy and fun recipe that tastes so much better than store bought strawberry 
    milk.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      3 cups sliced strawberries (fresh or frozen), I used one 16-oz bag 
      frozen sliced strawberries
    </li>
    <li>
      ¾ cup granulated sugar
    </li>
    <li>
      ⅔ cup water
    </li>
    <li>
      milk , preferably whole or 2%; non-dairy milk can be substituted
    </li>
    <li>
      whipped cream , for topping (optional)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place the strawberries, sugar, and water in a saucepan set over medium 
      heat. Simmer for about 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until 
      slightly thickened. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and pour the strawberry mixture 
      through the strainer. Use the back of a spoon to press the strawberries 
      against the strainer, extracting as much juice/syrup as possible. If 
      there is any foam on top of the syrup you can scoop it off now. Chill 
      the syrup. 
    </li>
    <li>
      To serve: pour ¾ cup of milk into a glass and add syrup to taste 
      (I add about 3-4 tablespoons). Stir and serve.
    </li>
  </ol>
