  <h3>Thai Tea in Restaurants</h3>
  <p>
    During one of the conference days in Chicago, we escaped out to lunch at a 
    local Thai restaurant to explore more of the city’s culinary offerings. As 
    always, we’ll try to order something new and different. When we’re at a 
    Thai restaurant, it normally involves ordering our favorites. This includes 
    a curry dish,  one noodle dish and an appetizer. On top of that, we must 
    always have Thai iced tea. Because how can we NOT have Thai iced tea when 
    we eat Thai food? It’s one of those decant “dessert” drinks that helps 
    soothe the burn when we overload on too much of Thai spice.

  <h3>Authentic Thai Tea Recipe</h3>
  <p>
    Years ago, my Auntie Chung was telling me how easy it was to make Thai iced 
    tea. She had worked in an Asian restaurant and one of the most popular 
    items on the entire menu was Thai iced tea. She proceeded to tell me 
    exactly how to make it and how profitable it was for restaurants to make. 
    I didn’t care too much about the profitability of Thai iced tea. But 
    rather, I’m more interested on how easily it was made and why we didn’t 
    make it more often. The version we have is as authentic as what most Thai 
    restaurants in America are making. Our version really does taste like what 
    we have ordered at most Thai restaurants.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup (80g)

         Thai Tea Mix
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>4 cups (960 ml) water</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (240ml) half and half 
        <em>
          approximately, (some folks also use coconut milk, whole milk,
          sweetened condensed milk)
        </em>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Bring water to boil and add the thai tea mix. Add sugar and gently stir 
      to completely dissolve sugar. Gently boil tea for about 3 minutes. Remove 
      from heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow tea to steep for at least 30 minutes and allow it to cool. The more 
      concentrated the tea flavor, the better the Thai tea tastes.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are using the Thai tea mix, strain the tea leaves (we love using 
      these

      ). Set finished Thai tea aside to cool. You 
      can make this ahead of time and have the Thai tea chilling in the fridge. 
      We usually like to make this tea mix one day ahead.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill glasses with ice and pour in Thai tea leaving enough room to fill in 
      your half and half (or other creamer). For an 8 oz. glass we like to add 
      about 2-3 tablespoons of half and half for a creamier flavor.
    </li>
